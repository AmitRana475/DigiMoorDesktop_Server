 <p>The Software will “Auto-Freeze” data as per set frequency of days from the setting as in screenshot. No crew member will be able to insert/edit/delete their work hours for the frozen data.
</p>
<p> <b>
For eg:- </b> 
If today is 04th March 2017 and automatic freezing frequency is set to 2 Days, no crew will be able to insert/edit/delete their work hours for any date on and before 02nd March 2017.

</p>
</br>
<p>However, there is an additional procedure to unfreeze / freeze data manually, as follows – </br>

Admin, Master and/or HOD (with permission) can freeze or unfreeze desired date values for All Crew :
 </p>
<p><b>Manual Freeze:</b> All Crew will not be able to insert/edit/delete any work hours records, for the chosen period. This will override the auto-freeze function.</p>

<p><b>Unfreeze: </b> All Crew Work & Rest hours will be opened to make changes for the chosen period. This will override the auto-freeze function. .</p>


<p>To Freeze or Unfreeze values, select "From" & "To" dates and press respective "Unfreeze" or "Freeze" button, which will be followed by a successful prompt.</p>
